Installation
============

The installation process is the usual one for Elgg plugins.

1. First make sure you have a working installation of Elgg.

2. Copy the elgg-latex directory to the "mod" directory of your Elgg installation.

3. Log in as an administrator and go to "Administration->Tool Administration"
Find the "elgg-latex" entry and click "Enable"
4. Make sure that you also disable any WYSIWYG editors, such as the TinyMCE plugin, because these do not play well with LaTeX markup.

Testing Your Installation
=========================

To test that your installation is working create a new blog post, page, message, etc. and enter some LaTeX markup, e.g.

\section{First Section}

\begin{equation}
E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4
\end{equation}

After submitting your post, you should see the markup typset correctly. If not, check the TROUBLESHOOTING file. For further information see the USAGE file.
